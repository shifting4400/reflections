When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If my hard drive fails then I don't loose all my data because it is in the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It might pull changes and write over my files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Ain't nobody got time for that.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

I have the newest changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would use svn probably.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Every branch can stand for a different logical part of the whole system.
