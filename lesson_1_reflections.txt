How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It makes easier to find any typed mistakes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It's probably for the mistakes again, or if I want to go back to az earlier version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

pros: I don't have to manually save every single time when I want to
cons: It might save files even the project doesn't work

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

On Git files can be more connected to each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log shows all the commits from all the people. Each commit has a different id.
Git diff can look for defferences in different commits by their id's.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It's possible to make mistakes, now I don't have to be that careful.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Version controlling would be great :)
